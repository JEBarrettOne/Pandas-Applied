Observed trends: 

1) The age distribution of players according to the defined brackets appears to have a normal distribution around the 20-24 bracket, 
   nearly 85% of players are contained within 15-19, 20-24, & 25-29. 
2) The per player purchase value and average price of items purchased by members of all gender categories are nearly identical, even as
   the gross of the male gender players clearly outstrips the gross of either the female or unreported players. This can be readily explained
   as the proportion of male:female:unreported players mirrors the proportion of their gross expenses.
3) It was not clear, at least on first pass, that items in the game are not sold at a set price dictated by the game. Observed differences in
   the sale price of the same item across multiple transactions indicates that either a player mediated or central influence on the price of items 
   can be expected over time.
